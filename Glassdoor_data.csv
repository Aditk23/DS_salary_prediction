About Us
Most of the world’s digital information was created in the last few years with the vast majority of that information being unstructured in the form of text, tweets, videos, images, blogs, etc. The rate of growth of digital information vastly exceeds our biological processing abilities. The consequence for investors is that it’s becoming harder to make sense of the factors that drive financial markets. Acting upon partial understanding of vast quantities of information (i.e., heuristics) infuses investment decisions with cognitive biases. In order to beat markets and make money, humans need to augment their reasoning capacity, consider the relevance of more information, and make bias-free decisions.
At Accrete.AI, our vision is to help investors generate alpha, or excess returns, by training machines to think in the language of the markets. We leverage deep learning and Machine Augmented Collective Intelligence (MACI) to train machines to reason and learn so they can help human investors make better investment decisions.

Associate Scientist – Data Scientist,₹281K - ₹574K (Glassdoor Est.),"ICRISAT seeks applications for the post of Associate Scientist – Data Scientist to be based within the Systems Analysis for Climate Smart Agriculture (SACSA) team and to be based at ICRISAT Headquarters in India.
ICRISAT is a non-profit, non-political organization that conducts agricultural research for development in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa with a wide array of partners throughout the world. ICRISAT and its partners help empower those living in the semi-arid tropics, especially smallholder farmers, to overcome poverty, hunger, malnutrition and a degraded environment through more efficient and profitable agriculture.
ICRISAT is headquartered in Patancheru near Hyderabad, India, with two regional hubs and five country offices in sub-Saharan Africa. ICRISAT, established in 1972, is a member of the CGIAR Consortium. For more details, see www.icrisat.org.
The sequestration and management of soil carbon is of central importance to climate smart agriculture. It’s management over the long-term has a direct bearing on resource sustainability and the livelihoods of small farmers. However, the great diversity of agri-environmental systems means that a one-size-fits-all approach to increase soil C is both unfeasible and unreasonable.
The concentration of soil organic C (SOC) is one of the soil’s most important characteristics that determines its capacity to withstand physical, chemical and microbial degradation. The SOC concentration is also generally associated with the productive capacity of the soil to sustain plant growth and microbial functioning. The build-up of SOC improves soil quality and contributes significantly to improving yields and yield stability, especially under drought stress.
More recently SOC has increasingly been recognised as having an important role to play to help mitigate climate change by sequestering carbon. However, in many valuable agricultural soils, SOC stocks are declining due to over exploitation, low soil protection, destructive soil management practices and inadequate replenishment. Halting the rate of decline and increasing SOC sequestration to ensure stable productivity of soils and contribution to climate change mitigation requires a nexus approach taking interactions of soil, water, and climate into account. Understanding these interactions can then form the basis for developing strategies to motivate farmers using agricultural practices increasing SOC.
Accordingly, the overall objective of the proposed work is to conduct a detailed and rigorous assessment of agricultural management practices for their potential to sequester C. The project will produce specific comparisons for different agro-ecologies in India and provide insights regarding the interactions between soil-water-climate. The project will do by value-adding to datasets of current systems with high level analysis, and implementing systems analysis to investigate alternative systems. The project will build on exiting partnerships with other CGIAR research centres, Indian government departments and NGOs, as well as establish new international collaborations.
Responsibilities:
Compile and develop databases of soil, crop, climate, landuse data for different agri-environmental settings in India
Co-develop systems computer simulations of actual and theoretical system using frameworks that include soil carbon (i.e. APSIM, DSSAT, Century, DNDC)
Utilize biophysical modelling to analyze the links between soils, crops, management and environment in India,
Interact with national and international collaborators to learn and then develop bespoke methods to simulate agri-environmental systems,
Develop advanced analysis methods such as machine learning and data mining to analyse large data sets
Review the relevant literature and consult with project partners to develop analysis scenarios for sustainable intensification,
Propose innovative climate smart solution to the challenges faced by farmers and communities of the semi-arid and sub-humid tropics,
Compiles draft reports on project progress for review and approval
Act as a central point to coordinate the management of data and information in interaction with other research centers, Indian government departments and NGOs
Essentials:
PhD in soil science, agronomy, data science, modelling, agricultural science or related field with 2 – 4 years of experience.
Experience in use of simulation modelling tools for systems analysis
Experience in collecting and statistically analyzing diverse data for systems research
Detailed understanding of the interactions between soils, crops, climate, agricultural management and environment
Demonstrated capacity to turn innovations into well-developed written and spoken English scientific output such as research articles and project reports
Demonstrated implementation of programming skills such as R or Python
Understanding of the impact of management soil processes, notably organic carbon turnover
Desirable
Understanding of the function of components of cropping systems/soil systems models such as APSIM, DSSAT, Century/Daycent, DNDC
Demonstrated implementation of programming skills in C++ or VisualBasic.NET
Good understanding of statistical analyses of crop modeling outputs and experience with statistical software packages would be an advantage
Knowledge of challenges faced by farmers and rural communities of the semi-arid/sub-humid tropics
